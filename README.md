# odin-recipes
My first GitHub website for recipes!

In this project I will produce a simple website that includes several links to recipes.
Each recipe will include unordered and ordered lists and include an image. 

This project will allow me to practice the basic skills of creating HTML documents, including links, lists, and images.

Self reflection: include when finished.
